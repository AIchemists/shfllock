===============================================

### Paper
* [Scalable And Practical Locking with Shuffling (SOSP 2019)]()

### Overview
ShflLocks are a family of locking protocols that
implement use shuffling mechanism to implement several policies,
such as NUMA-awareness, or blocking. We implement three locking
protocols: NUMA-aware spinlock, NUMA-aware blocking mutex,
and NUMA-aware blocking rwlock.
